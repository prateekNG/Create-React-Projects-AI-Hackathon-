## README.md

This project demonstrates using Gemini's generative AI model (`gemini-1.5-flash`) to create scaffolded project guides for React applications based on various project ideas.

**Project Goal:**

This project automates generating detailed project guides for students learning React by building various applications. 

**Technology Stack:**

* JavaScript (Node.js)
* `@google/generative-ai` library
* fs (file system) module

**How it Works:**

1. The script loads a pre-defined JSON template containing sections for a scaffolded React project guide.
2. It iterates through a list of project ideas.
3. For each idea, a prompt is crafted that includes the JSON template and the specific project idea.
4. The script uses the `@google/generative-ai` library to call the Gemini model and generate content based on the prompt.
5. The generated text, which represents the detailed scaffolded project guide for the specific idea, is written to a separate markdown file named after the project idea (with underscores replacing spaces).

**Running the Script:**

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install the required dependency:

```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

4. Set up your API key for accessing Gemini (refer to official documentation for details).
5. Run the script:

```bash
node generateProjects.js
```

This will generate markdown files in the `projects` directory, each containing a scaffolded project guide for a specific idea from the provided list.

**Note:**

* You will need to replace the placeholder content in the `sampleProjectScaffold.txt` file with your desired structure for the project guide.
* This script is a basic example and can be further customized to fit your specific needs.
