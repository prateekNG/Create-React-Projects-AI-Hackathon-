## Project Title: Book Exchange and Library Network

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that allows users to register, add books to a virtual library, search for books, borrow books, and exchange books with other users.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:** 
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:** 
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app book-exchange`.
    * **Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Core Components and Basic Functionality**

**Objective:** Define core components and implement basic features like registration and book listing.

* **User Registration Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `RegistrationForm` component to handle user registration.
    * **Instructions:** Use a form to collect user information (username, email, password) and handle data submission.
    * **Implementation:** Use `useState` to manage form inputs and `fetch` to send registration data to a backend API (or use a mock API).
* **Book Listing Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `BookList` component to display a list of available books.
    * **Instructions:** Fetch book data from a backend API (or mock API) and render each book with its title, author, genre, etc.
    * **Implementation:** Use `useEffect` to fetch data on component mount and `useState` to store the fetched data.
    * **Styling:** Apply basic CSS to style the book list.

**Phase 3: User Authentication and Data Persistence**

**Objective:** Implement user authentication and handle data persistence.

* **Authentication Integration:**
    * **Task:** Integrate a user authentication system (e.g., JWT or session-based authentication).
    * **Instructions:** Use a backend API to handle authentication and store user data securely.
    * **Implementation:** Store authentication tokens in local storage and use them for API requests.
* **Data Storage:**
    * **Task:** Implement data persistence for user data and book information.
    * **Instructions:** Use a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user and book data.
    * **Implementation:** Utilize a backend API to interact with the database and update the frontend state accordingly.

**Phase 4: Book Search and Filtering**

**Objective:** Add search and filtering functionality to the book list.

* **Search Bar Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `SearchBar` component that allows users to search for books.
    * **Instructions:** Use an input field to receive search queries.
    * **Implementation:** Implement event handling to trigger search requests when the search query changes.
    * **Filtering Logic:** Implement logic in the `BookList` component to filter books based on the search query.
* **Filtering Options:**
    * **Task:** Add filter options (e.g., by genre, author, etc.) to the `BookList` component.
    * **Instructions:** Use dropdowns or checkboxes to provide filtering options.
    * **Implementation:** Update the `BookList` component to filter books based on selected filters.

**Phase 5: Borrowing and Exchanging Books**

**Objective:** Implement borrowing and exchanging functionalities for books.

* **Borrow Book Functionality:**
    * **Task:** Add a "Borrow" button to each book in the `BookList` component.
    * **Instructions:** Handle button clicks to update the book status and send a request to the backend.
    * **Implementation:** Use `fetch` to update the book status in the database and update the frontend state.
* **Book Exchange Functionality:**
    * **Task:** Implement a feature to allow users to exchange their borrowed books with other users.
    * **Instructions:** Add an "Exchange" button for borrowed books, allowing users to search for another book to exchange with.
    * **Implementation:** Use API calls to update book status, notify the other user, and manage the exchange process.

**Phase 6: User Profile and Book History**

**Objective:** Implement user profile and book history features.

* **User Profile Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `UserProfile` component to display a user's profile information.
    * **Instructions:** Fetch user data from the API and render the profile details.
    * **Implementation:** Use `useEffect` to fetch user data and `useState` to manage profile information.
* **Book History Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `BookHistory` component to display a user's history of borrowed and exchanged books.
    * **Instructions:** Fetch book history data from the API and render the history list.
    * **Implementation:** Use `useEffect` to fetch data and `useState` to manage the book history list.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionalities are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code. 
* **API Integration:** The application effectively interacts with a backend API (or mock API) for authentication, data persistence, and other functionalities.

This scaffolded project guide provides a structured approach to learning React by building a complex web application. Each phase builds on previous knowledge, allowing students to gradually gain proficiency in React development.
