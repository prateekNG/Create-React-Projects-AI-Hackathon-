## Project Title: Bus Booking System

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a functional React application that allows users to search for buses, view available trips, and book tickets for intercity and intracity routes.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

**Install Node.js and npm:**

* **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
* **Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.

**Create a New React Project:**

* **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
* **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-bus-booking-app`.
* **Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.

**Project Structure Overview:**

* **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
* **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Basic Components and Data Structure**

**Objective:** Create basic components and define the structure for bus trip data.

**Define Trip Data Structure:**

* **Task:** Create a JavaScript object or an array of objects to represent bus trip data.
* **Instructions:**  Include properties like departure city, arrival city, date, time, bus operator, price, available seats, etc.
* **Example:** `const trips = [{ departureCity: "New York", arrivalCity: "Chicago", date: "2023-12-10", time: "10:00 AM", ... }];`

**Create Search Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component called `SearchForm` that allows users to enter departure and arrival cities and select a travel date.
* **Instructions:** Include input fields for cities, a date picker, and a search button.

**Create Bus List Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component called `BusList` that displays a list of available trips based on the search criteria.
* **Instructions:** Render the `BusList` component within `App.js`.

**Phase 3: Data Fetching and Filtering**

**Objective:** Implement data fetching from an external source (API or mock data) and filter trips based on user input.

**Implement Data Fetching (Mock Data or API):**

* **Task:** Choose a method for fetching trip data:
    * **Mock Data:** Create a JSON file containing sample bus trip data.
    * **API:** Utilize an existing bus API or create a simple mock API using tools like JSON Placeholder or a local server.
* **Instructions:** Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch trip data when the component mounts.

**Implement Search Filtering:**

* **Task:** Filter the fetched trip data based on the user input in the `SearchForm` component.
* **Instructions:** Use JavaScript filter methods to filter the trips based on departure city, arrival city, and selected date.

**Render Filtered Trips:**

* **Task:** Update the `BusList` component to display the filtered trips.
* **Instructions:** Map over the filtered trip data and render a `TripCard` component for each trip.

**Phase 4: Trip Detail and Booking**

**Objective:** Display detailed trip information and implement a booking functionality.

**Create Trip Card Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component called `TripCard` to display information for each trip.
* **Instructions:** Include properties like departure city, arrival city, date, time, bus operator, price, and available seats.

**Create Trip Detail Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component called `TripDetail` to display detailed information about a selected trip.
* **Instructions:** Pass the selected trip data as a prop to the `TripDetail` component.

**Implement Booking Functionality:**

* **Task:** Add a "Book Now" button in the `TripDetail` component.
* **Instructions:** Handle the button click to trigger a booking process. Implement state management to track the number of seats selected.
* **Optional:**  Consider using a modal or pop-up to confirm the booking details.

**Phase 5: State Management and User Experience**

**Objective:** Manage application state and enhance the user experience with interactive elements.

**Implement State Management:**

* **Task:** Use the `useState` hook to manage application state for:
    * The list of trips fetched from the API or mock data.
    * The selected trip details.
    * Booking details (number of seats selected).
* **Instructions:** Update the state when the search form is submitted or when a user selects a trip.

**Enhance User Experience:**

* **Task:** Implement features like:
    * **Loading Indicator:** Show a loading indicator while fetching data.
    * **Error Handling:** Display an error message if data fetching fails.
    * **Pagination:** If the number of trips is large, implement pagination to display them in chunks.
    * **Visual Feedback:** Use visual cues like highlighting to indicate the selected trip.

**Phase 6: Styling and Accessibility**

**Objective:** Style the application and ensure accessibility for all users.

**Apply Basic CSS:**

* **Task:** Create CSS files for different components and apply styles to the layout, elements, and interactions.
* **Instructions:** Import the CSS files into your components and use class names to target specific elements.

**Consider Accessibility:**

* **Task:** Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
* **Instructions:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes, semantic HTML elements, and color contrast guidelines.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **User Experience:** The application is user-friendly and provides a seamless booking experience.
* **Styling and Accessibility:** The application is visually appealing and accessible to all users.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
