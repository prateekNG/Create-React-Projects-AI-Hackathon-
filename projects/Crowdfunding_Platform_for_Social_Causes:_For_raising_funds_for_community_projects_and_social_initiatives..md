## Project Title: Crowdfunding for Social Good: Building a Simple React Application

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a basic React application that allows users to create and view crowdfunding campaigns for social causes, simulating the core functionality of a crowdfunding platform. 

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-crowdfunding-app`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2:  Creating Core Components**

**Objective:**  Structure the application with basic components and define their functionalities.

* **Campaign Card Component:**
    * Task: Create a component `CampaignCard` to display information about each crowdfunding campaign.
    * Instructions: Define the structure for displaying campaign title, description, current funds raised, target amount, and a progress bar.
* **Campaign List Component:**
    * Task: Create a component `CampaignList` to display a list of campaigns.
    * Instructions: Use `CampaignCard` within `CampaignList` to dynamically render multiple campaign cards.
* **Create Campaign Form Component:**
    * Task: Create a component `CreateCampaignForm` for users to submit new campaign details.
    * Instructions: Implement form fields for campaign title, description, target amount, and an image upload feature (optional). 

**Phase 3: State and Props Management**

**Objective:**  Implement state and props management to handle data flow and dynamic updates.

* **Campaign Data Management:**
    * Task: Create a global state object to store an array of campaign data.
    * Instructions: Use a state management library like `useState` or a more complex library like `Redux` or `Context API` to manage campaign data.
* **Displaying Campaigns:**
    * Task: Fetch campaign data from the state and render it in `CampaignList`.
    * Instructions: Pass campaign data as props to `CampaignCard` for dynamic rendering.
* **Updating State with New Campaigns:**
    * Task: Implement functionality to add new campaigns to the state when submitted from `CreateCampaignForm`.
    * Instructions: Update the state with new campaign data upon form submission.

**Phase 4: User Interaction and Functionality**

**Objective:**  Enable user interactions, including form submission and donation functionality.

* **Handling Form Submission:**
    * Task: Implement event handling for the `CreateCampaignForm` to capture user input.
    * Instructions: Use event listeners to capture form input and update the state with new campaign data.
* **Updating Campaign Progress:**
    * Task: Implement functionality to update the progress bar of each campaign based on donations.
    * Instructions: Add a donation button to `CampaignCard` and update the campaign's progress in the state based on donations.
* **Visual Feedback:**
    * Task: Provide visual feedback to the user after form submission and donations.
    * Instructions: Implement success messages, confirmation popups, or loading indicators to confirm actions.

**Phase 5: Styling and User Interface Design**

**Objective:**  Enhance the visual appeal and usability of the application.

* **CSS Styling:**
    * Task: Create CSS files to style the application's components.
    * Instructions: Apply styles to components like `CampaignCard`, `CampaignList`, and `CreateCampaignForm` to improve their appearance.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Task: Ensure the application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
    * Instructions: Use media queries in CSS or a CSS framework to optimize layout for different devices.
* **Improving User Experience:**
    * Task: Add visual elements like progress bars, animations, or interactive elements to enhance the user experience.
    * Instructions: Implement features to make the application more engaging and user-friendly.

**Phase 6: (Optional) Data Persistence**

**Objective:**  Implement data storage to persist campaign information.

* **Local Storage or Database:**
    * Task: Choose a method to store campaign data persistently (e.g., localStorage, a database).
    * Instructions: Implement logic to save and load campaign data from the chosen method.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
