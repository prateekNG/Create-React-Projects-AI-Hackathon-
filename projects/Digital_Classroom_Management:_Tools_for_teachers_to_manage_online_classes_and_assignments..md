## Project Title: Digital Classroom Management

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that allows teachers to manage their online classes and assignments. This includes features like creating and managing student lists, assigning homework, and tracking student progress.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

**Install Node.js and npm:**

**Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.

**Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.

**Create a New React Project:**

**Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.

**Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-classroom-app`.

**Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.

**Project Structure Overview:**

**Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.

**Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Building the Core Components**

**Objective:**  Define the basic components of the application.

**Create the `App` Component:**

**Task:**  Build the main `App` component that will contain the entire classroom management interface.

**Instructions:** Structure the `App` component to include navigation, a main content area, and potentially a sidebar for options.

**Create the `ClassList` Component:**

**Task:** Design a `ClassList` component that will display a list of students in a class.

**Instructions:** Include functionality to add, remove, and edit student information within this component.

**Create the `Assignment` Component:**

**Task:** Develop an `Assignment` component to manage individual assignments.

**Instructions:**  Include functionality to create, edit, and delete assignments. This component should allow teachers to set deadlines, upload instructions, and track submission status.

**Phase 3: State Management with Context API**

**Objective:** Implement state management for the application.

**Introduction to Context API:**

**Task:** Read about the Context API and its role in managing global application state in React.

**Resources:** Provide a tutorial or documentation link about the Context API.

**Implement Global State:**

**Task:** Create a context provider to manage global state for classroom data, including student information and assignment data.

**Instructions:** Use the context provider to make these data accessible to all components within the application.

**Update Components with Context:**

**Task:** Update the `ClassList`, `Assignment`, and other components to consume the context provider.

**Instructions:** Retrieve relevant data from the context and use it to render the appropriate information within each component.

**Phase 4: User Input and Event Handling**

**Objective:** Develop functionality for user interaction and data manipulation.

**Introduction to Event Handling:**

**Task:**  Review event handling in React.

**Resources:** Provide links to React documentation on event handling.

**Implement User Input:**

**Task:** Add input fields to the `ClassList` and `Assignment` components to allow teachers to enter information.

**Instructions:** Utilize controlled components to manage input values within the state.

**Handle Form Submissions:**

**Task:** Implement event handlers for form submissions within the `ClassList` and `Assignment` components.

**Instructions:**  Upon submission, update the state to add new students or assignments, or to modify existing data.

**Phase 5: Data Persistence with Local Storage**

**Objective:**  Store and retrieve data to make it persistent between user sessions.

**Introduction to Local Storage:**

**Task:** Learn about the use of local storage for storing data in the browser.

**Resources:** Provide a tutorial on using local storage in React.

**Implement Data Persistence:**

**Task:** Integrate local storage with the context provider.

**Instructions:** Use `localStorage` to store and retrieve data whenever the global state is updated. Ensure the app loads data from local storage on initialization.

**Phase 6: Styling the Application (Optional)**

**Objective:** Enhance the visual appearance of the application.

**Introduction to Styling in React:**

**Task:**  Explore different ways to style React components (CSS, inline styles, CSS-in-JS).

**Resources:** Provide a tutorial on styling methods in React.

**Apply Basic CSS:**

**Task:**  Create CSS files for the main components and apply styles.

**Instructions:** Import the CSS files into the relevant components and add class names to elements for styling.

**Enhance UI:**

**Task:**  Improve the visual appeal of the application.

**Instructions:** Use CSS to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for the digital classroom management tool.

**Final Project Submission**

**Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.

**Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.

**Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

**Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.

**Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.

**Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
