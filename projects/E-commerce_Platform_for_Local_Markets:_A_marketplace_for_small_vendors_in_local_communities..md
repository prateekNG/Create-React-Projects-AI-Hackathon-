## Project Title: Building an E-commerce Platform for Local Markets

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a basic React application that simulates an e-commerce platform for local markets, allowing vendors to list their products and customers to browse and purchase items.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

**Install Node.js and npm:**

* Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
* Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.

**Create a New React Project:**

* Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
* Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-market-app`.
* Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.

**Project Structure Overview:**

* Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
* Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Basic Components and Layout**

**Objective:** Create the fundamental components and structure of the marketplace.

**Vendor Listing Component:**

* Task: Create a `VendorListing` component that displays a list of vendors.
* Instructions: Design the component to show the vendor name, logo (placeholder image), and a link to their shop.

**Shop Component:**

* Task: Create a `Shop` component that represents a single vendor's shop.
* Instructions: Design the component to display the vendor name, logo, a list of products, and a contact section.

**Product Component:**

* Task: Create a `Product` component to display a single product.
* Instructions: Design the component to show the product name, image, description, price, and a "Add to Cart" button.

**Layout Component:**

* Task: Create a `Layout` component to structure the overall website.
* Instructions: Include a navigation bar with links to "Home", "Vendors", and "Cart", and a container for the main content.

**Phase 3: Data Management and Routing**

**Objective:** Implement data management and navigation between components.

**Data Fetching and Storage:**

* Task: Choose a data management strategy (e.g., local JSON data, simple API, Mock API).
* Task: Implement data fetching to load vendor and product information.
* Task: Choose a state management library (e.g., React Context, Redux) or use `useState` for simple data management.

**Routing with React Router:**

* Task: Install React Router: `npm install react-router-dom`.
* Task: Implement routing to navigate between the "Home", "Vendors", "Shop", and "Cart" pages.
* Task: Dynamically display the relevant component based on the URL.

**Phase 4: User Interaction and Cart Functionality**

**Objective:** Implement user interaction with the marketplace, including cart management.

**Product Details View:**

* Task: Create a `ProductDetails` component to display detailed product information.
* Instructions: Include a larger image, more detailed description, and options for quantity and size (if applicable).

**Cart Management:**

* Task: Create a `Cart` component to manage the user's cart.
* Instructions: Display a list of items in the cart, allowing users to adjust quantities and remove items.
* Task: Implement functionality to add products to the cart when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked.

**Phase 5: Styling and User Interface Enhancement**

**Objective:** Enhance the visual appeal and usability of the marketplace.

**Styling with CSS:**

* Task: Choose a styling approach (e.g., inline styles, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS).
* Task: Create CSS styles for the components to create a consistent and visually appealing design.
* Task: Apply styling to elements like navigation bars, buttons, product cards, and shop pages.

**User Experience Improvements:**

* Task: Implement smooth transitions and animations for better user interaction.
* Task: Add search functionality to easily find vendors or products.
* Task: Consider accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

**Phase 6:  (Optional) Additional Features**

**Objective:** Add more advanced features to expand the functionality of the marketplace.

**User Authentication:**

* Task: Implement user registration and login.
* Task: Create a user profile page where users can manage their information and past orders.

**Payment Integration:**

* Task: Integrate with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to process orders.

**Vendor Dashboard:**

* Task: Create a vendor dashboard where vendors can manage their products, orders, and customer interactions.

**Final Project Submission**

**Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.

**Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.

**Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

**Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.

**Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.

**Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

**Creativity:** The student demonstrates creativity and originality in the design and features of their marketplace.

This scaffolded project provides a step-by-step approach to learning React, helping students build confidence and competence in developing a basic e-commerce platform. They will gain experience with essential concepts like data management, routing, state management, user interaction, and styling.
