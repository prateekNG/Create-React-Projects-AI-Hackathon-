## Educational Portal for Competitive Exams: Resources and Test Preparation

**Objective:** By the end of this project, students will have built a basic React application that provides access to educational resources and test preparation tools for competitive exams like UPSC, IIT-JEE, and NEET.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** [Node.js Installation Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-exam-portal`.
    * **Resources:** [Create React App Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Defining Components and Structure**

**Objective:** Create the basic components and structure for the educational portal.

* **Create Main Layout Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `Layout` component to act as the main container for the application.
    * **Instructions:** Include header, navigation, and content areas within the layout.
* **Create Navigation Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `Navigation` component for displaying the main navigation links.
    * **Instructions:** Include links for exams (UPSC, IIT-JEE, NEET), resources, and contact.
* **Create Exam Category Components:**
    * **Task:** Create individual components for each exam category (UPSC, IIT-JEE, NEET).
    * **Instructions:** These components will display specific resources and information for each exam.
* **Create Resource Listing Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `ResourceList` component to display a list of resources.
    * **Instructions:** Include the title, description, and link for each resource.

**Phase 3: Fetching and Displaying Data**

**Objective:** Fetch data for educational resources and display them in the application.

* **Introduce Data Fetching:**
    * **Task:** Research and choose a method for fetching data (e.g., JSON Placeholder, a local JSON file, or a backend API).
    * **Resources:** [React Data Fetching Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect)
* **Implement Data Fetching:**
    * **Task:** Implement the data fetching logic within the appropriate components (e.g., `ExamCategory` components).
    * **Instructions:** Use `useEffect` hook to fetch data and store it in the component's state.
* **Display Resource Data:**
    * **Task:** Dynamically render resource data fetched from the chosen data source within the `ResourceList` component.
    * **Instructions:** Map over the fetched data and display each resource using the `ResourceList` component.

**Phase 4: User Interaction and Navigation**

**Objective:** Enhance the application with user interaction and navigation between different sections.

* **Navigation Click Handling:**
    * **Task:** Implement event handlers for the navigation links in the `Navigation` component.
    * **Instructions:** Use `useState` to manage the current active section and update it when a navigation link is clicked.
* **Dynamic Section Rendering:**
    * **Task:** Implement conditional rendering based on the current active section.
    * **Instructions:** Display the relevant content (exam category components, resources, etc.) based on the selected navigation link.
* **Search Functionality:**
    * **Task:** Add a search bar to filter resources based on keywords.
    * **Instructions:** Use event handling and filtering logic to display relevant resources based on user input.

**Phase 5: Styling and UI Enhancements**

**Objective:** Apply styling and UI elements to improve the appearance and user experience.

* **Basic Styling:**
    * **Task:** Create a CSS file and apply basic styles to the components.
    * **Instructions:** Style elements like headers, navigation, resource listings, and buttons.
* **UI Design:**
    * **Task:** Design a visually appealing layout and use UI components (e.g., cards, icons) for better presentation.
    * **Resources:** [React Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
* **Responsiveness:**
    * **Task:** Ensure the application is responsive and displays correctly across different screen sizes.
    * **Instructions:** Use media queries or responsive design frameworks to adjust layout and elements for different devices.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
