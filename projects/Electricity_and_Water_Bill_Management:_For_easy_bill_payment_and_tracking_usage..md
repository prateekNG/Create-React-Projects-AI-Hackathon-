## Project Title: Electricity and Water Bill Management

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that allows users to manage their electricity and water bills, track usage, and make payments.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-bill-manager`.
    * **Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Building the User Interface**

**Objective:** Design and build the basic UI for the bill management application.

* **Create a Navigation Bar Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `Navbar` to provide navigation between different sections of the application (e.g., bills, usage, payments).
    * **Instructions:** Use functional components and JSX to design a navigation bar with links to relevant sections.
* **Create a Bill List Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `BillList` to display a list of electricity and water bills.
    * **Instructions:** Implement a simple table structure using JSX to display bill details (e.g., bill ID, provider, due date, amount).
* **Create a Bill Details Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `BillDetails` to display detailed information about a selected bill.
    * **Instructions:** Use JSX to create a detailed view for a bill, including information like bill ID, provider, amount, due date, and usage history.
* **Create a Payment Form Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `PaymentForm` to handle payment information for a selected bill.
    * **Instructions:** Use JSX to design a form with input fields for payment amount, payment method, and payment date.

**Phase 3: Managing Bill Data**

**Objective:** Implement functionality to store and manage bill information.

* **Implement Local Storage:**
    * **Task:** Utilize local storage to store and retrieve bill data locally on the user's device.
    * **Instructions:** Create functions to save and load bill data from local storage.
* **Handle Bill Creation:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to add new bill information to the local storage.
    * **Instructions:** Add a button in the `BillList` component to trigger a modal or form to add new bill details.
* **Handle Bill Editing:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to edit existing bill information.
    * **Instructions:** Allow users to modify bill details by providing an edit button in the `BillDetails` component.
* **Handle Bill Deletion:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to delete bills from the local storage.
    * **Instructions:** Provide a delete button in the `BillDetails` component to remove selected bills.

**Phase 4: Tracking Usage**

**Objective:** Implement functionality to track electricity and water usage.

* **Create Usage Tracker Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `UsageTracker` to allow users to track their electricity and water usage.
    * **Instructions:** Implement a form with input fields for usage readings (e.g., kilowatt-hours for electricity, gallons for water).
* **Store Usage Data:**
    * **Task:** Store usage data for each bill in local storage.
    * **Instructions:** Integrate the usage tracker component with the bill data storage system.
* **Display Usage History:**
    * **Task:** Display usage history in the `BillDetails` component.
    * **Instructions:** Create a chart or table to visualize historical usage readings for the selected bill.

**Phase 5: Handling Payments**

**Objective:** Implement functionality for payment processing.

* **Implement Payment Submission:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to submit payment information through the `PaymentForm` component.
    * **Instructions:** Create a backend API endpoint (or use a mock API) to receive payment data.
* **Handle Payment Success and Failure:**
    * **Task:** Handle payment success and failure scenarios.
    * **Instructions:** Display appropriate messages to the user based on payment processing results.
* **Update Bill Status:**
    * **Task:** Update the bill status in local storage upon successful payment.
    * **Instructions:** Reflect payment status changes in the `BillList` and `BillDetails` components.

**Phase 6: Enhancing User Experience**

**Objective:** Improve the user experience through styling and additional features.

* **Style the Application:**
    * **Task:** Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library to style the application components.
    * **Instructions:** Add styles for visual appeal, improved layout, and user-friendliness.
* **Implement Search Functionality:**
    * **Task:** Add a search bar to filter bills based on criteria like bill ID or provider.
    * **Instructions:** Filter bill data based on user search input and update the `BillList` component.
* **Add Charts and Visualizations:**
    * **Task:** Implement charts or graphs to visualize bill information and usage data.
    * **Instructions:** Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) to create interactive visualizations.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a structured approach to learning React by building a functional and user-friendly bill management application. Students will gain practical experience with React components, state management, data handling, and UI design.
