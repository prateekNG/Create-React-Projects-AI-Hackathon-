## Project Title: Food Delivery App for Regional Cuisines

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that allows users to browse and order dishes from a variety of regional Indian cuisines, showcasing their understanding of fundamental React concepts.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-food-app`.
    * **Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Designing the App Layout and Components**

**Objective:** Plan the user interface and create basic components for the app.

* **App Structure:**
    * **Task:** Sketch out a wireframe or basic design for the app, including:
        * Navigation (e.g., home page, cuisine categories, cart).
        * Main content areas (e.g., dish listings, restaurant details).
    * **Activity:** Discuss and refine the design with your team or instructor.
* **Create Core Components:**
    * **Task:** Create components for the following:
        * `Navbar`: Handles navigation between different sections of the app.
        * `CuisineList`: Displays a list of available cuisines.
        * `DishList`: Displays a list of dishes for a selected cuisine.
        * `DishDetails`: Shows details of a specific dish (name, description, price, image).
        * `Cart`: Manages the user's cart, allowing them to add, remove, and view items.
* **Component Structure:**
    * **Task:** Decide on the structure of each component and its props/state.
    * **Example:** 
        * `DishList` might take a cuisine as a prop and manage its own state for the list of dishes.
        * `DishDetails` would take a dish object as a prop.

**Phase 3: Fetching and Displaying Data**

**Objective:** Learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in the app.

* **API Integration:**
    * **Task:** Choose an API (or create a mock one) to provide data for dishes and cuisines.
    * **Resources:** Explore APIs like `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=chicken` or consider creating a local JSON file for initial testing.
* **Data Fetching:**
    * **Task:** Implement the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the API when the component mounts.
    * **Example:** In `CuisineList`, fetch data for all available cuisines when the component loads.
* **Data Display:**
    * **Task:** Use the fetched data to populate the components.
    * **Example:** In `CuisineList`, map over the fetched data to render a list of cuisine links.

**Phase 4: Interactive Elements**

**Objective:** Implement user interactions, like choosing cuisines and adding items to the cart.

* **Cuisine Selection:**
    * **Task:** Allow users to select a cuisine from `CuisineList`, triggering a change in the displayed `DishList`.
    * **Example:** Pass the selected cuisine as a prop to `DishList`, which will then fetch and display relevant dishes.
* **Adding Items to Cart:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to add dishes to the cart from `DishDetails`.
    * **Example:** When a user clicks "Add to Cart", update the `Cart` component's state with the selected dish.
* **Cart Management:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality for users to view their cart, remove items, and potentially edit quantities.
    * **Example:** Render the items in the `Cart` component and allow users to click buttons to remove items.

**Phase 5: Styling and UI Enhancements**

**Objective:** Apply styles to improve the visual appearance and user experience.

* **Styling Approach:**
    * **Task:** Choose a styling method for your React app (CSS, inline styles, CSS-in-JS).
    * **Resources:** Research and choose between `styled-components`, `emotion`, or traditional CSS files.
* **Component Styling:**
    * **Task:** Style the components to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
    * **Example:** Style the `Navbar`, `DishList`, `DishDetails`, and `Cart` components with appropriate colors, fonts, and layouts.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * **Task:** Ensure the app is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
    * **Example:** Use media queries or responsive frameworks like `react-responsive` to adjust styling based on device size.

**Phase 6: Additional Features (Optional)**

**Objective:** Extend the functionality of the app by adding optional features.

* **User Authentication:**
    * **Task:** Allow users to create accounts and log in, potentially saving cart data or order history.
    * **Resources:** Explore authentication libraries like `firebase`, `auth0`, or `next-auth`.
* **Payment Integration:**
    * **Task:** Implement a payment gateway to allow users to place orders.
    * **Resources:** Investigate popular payment gateways like `Stripe`, `Paypal`, or `Razorpay`.
* **Order Tracking:**
    * **Task:** Allow users to track the status of their orders.
    * **Example:** Implement a feature to show order progress (e.g., "Order Placed", "Preparing", "Out for delivery").

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project guide provides a structured approach for students to learn React by developing a practical food delivery app with regional Indian cuisines as the focus. By completing each phase, students will gain a strong foundation in React and be able to build more complex web applications in the future.
