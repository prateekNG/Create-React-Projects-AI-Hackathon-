## Project Title: Home Cooked Meal Delivery App

### Objective:

By the end of this project, students will have created a functional React application for a home-cooked meal delivery service, demonstrating understanding of core React concepts like components, state, props, events, and styling.

### Phases and Tasks:

#### Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

**Install Node.js and npm:**
* **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
* **Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm. 

**Create a New React Project:**
* **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
* **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-home-cooked-app`.
* **Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.

**Project Structure Overview:**
* **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
* **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

#### Phase 2: Building the Basic UI

**Objective:** Create the foundational UI components of the app.

**Home Page Component:**
* **Task:** Create a `HomePage` component to display the app's core information.
* **Instructions:** Write a functional component returning a div with:
    * A title introducing the home-cooked meal delivery service.
    * Brief descriptions of the service's key features.
    * A call to action to explore the service.

**Meal Listing Component:**
* **Task:** Create a `MealListing` component to display available meals.
* **Instructions:** Write a functional component returning a div with:
    * A section title "Available Meals".
    * An unordered list (`<ul>`) with placeholder meal items (`<li>`).

**Meal Detail Component:**
* **Task:** Create a `MealDetail` component to showcase details of a selected meal.
* **Instructions:** Write a functional component returning a div with:
    * A section title "Meal Details".
    * Placeholder information for meal name, description, price, and chef information.

**Render Components:**
* **Task:** Render these components in the main `App` component.
* **Instructions:** Import components into `App.js` and include them in the JSX returned by `App`.

#### Phase 3: Implementing State Management

**Objective:** Utilize state to manage data and dynamically update the UI.

**Meal Data in State:**
* **Task:** Introduce state in the `MealListing` component to store meal data.
* **Instructions:** Use `useState` to initialize an array of objects, each representing a meal (e.g., name, description, price, chef).

**Dynamically Displaying Meals:**
* **Task:** Dynamically display meals in the `MealListing` component based on the state data.
* **Instructions:** Map over the meal array in the state and render a `MealItem` component for each meal.

**MealItem Component:**
* **Task:** Create a `MealItem` component to display individual meals in the listing.
* **Instructions:** Write a functional component receiving meal data as props and rendering:
    * Meal name, description, and price.
    * A button to view more details.

**Handling Meal Selection:**
* **Task:** Implement functionality to select a meal and display its details.
* **Instructions:** In `MealListing`, add an event handler for the "View Details" button that updates state to store the selected meal data.

#### Phase 4: Displaying Meal Details

**Objective:** Implement dynamic rendering of meal details based on user selection.

**Passing Props:**
* **Task:** Pass the selected meal data as props to the `MealDetail` component.
* **Instructions:** In `MealListing`, pass the selected meal state to the `MealDetail` component.

**Rendering Meal Details:**
* **Task:** Render the meal details received as props in the `MealDetail` component.
* **Instructions:** Display the meal's name, description, price, and chef information.

#### Phase 5: Implementing User Interactions

**Objective:** Implement user interactions to add meals and filter meal listings.

**Add Meal Functionality:**
* **Task:** Create a "Add Meal" feature for the chef to add new meal offerings.
* **Instructions:** Add an input field and a button to the `MealListing` component.
* **Task:** Handle user input for new meal details and update state with the new meal data.
* **Instructions:** Use state to store input values and an event handler to add the new meal to the meal array in state.

**Filtering Meals:**
* **Task:** Implement a filter feature for users to search for meals based on criteria (e.g., cuisine, price range).
* **Instructions:** Add a filter input field to `MealListing` and update the meal array in state based on the filter criteria.

#### Phase 6: Styling the Application

**Objective:** Apply styles to enhance the app's visual presentation.

**CSS Styling:**
* **Task:** Create a CSS file and link it to your React application.
* **Instructions:** Apply styles to elements like the homepage, meal listing, and meal details.

**Styling Components:**
* **Task:** Use CSS to style the layout, fonts, colors, and spacing of the app's components.
* **Instructions:** Ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly presentation.

**Responsive Design:**
* **Task:** Design the app to be responsive across various screen sizes.
* **Instructions:** Use CSS media queries or frameworks like Bootstrap to ensure the app adapts to different devices.

#### Phase 7: Enhancing Functionality (Optional)

**Objective:** Expand the app with additional features.

**User Account Management:**
* **Task:** Implement user registration and login functionality.
* **Instructions:** Use a backend service or library to manage user accounts and authentication.

**Order Placement:**
* **Task:** Add functionality for users to place orders for meals.
* **Instructions:** Create a cart system and implement order processing functionality.

**Payment Integration:**
* **Task:** Integrate a payment gateway to facilitate secure online payments.
* **Instructions:** Choose a payment provider and follow their integration guidelines.

**Chef Profiles:**
* **Task:** Create a section to showcase profiles for chefs offering meals.
* **Instructions:** Display information like chef bio, specialties, and contact details.

#### Final Project Submission

**Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.

**Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.

**Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.
