## Project Title: Interactive Map of Historical Sites

**Objective:**
By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that displays an interactive map with markers representing historical sites. Clicking on a marker will reveal detailed information about the site, including images, text, and a virtual tour (if available).

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**
**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-react-app`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Implementing the Map Component**
**Objective:** Learn how to integrate a map library into a React application and display markers.

* **Choose a Map Library:**
    * Task: Research and select a suitable map library for your project (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps API).
    * Resources: Provide links to documentation and tutorials for chosen library.
* **Install the Map Library:**
    * Task: Install the chosen map library using npm.
    * Instructions: Run `npm install [library-name]` in the project directory.
* **Create a Map Component:**
    * Task: Create a new component called `Map` that renders the map using the chosen library.
    * Instructions: Initialize the map and set its initial view (center and zoom level).
    * Resources: Provide documentation examples and tutorials for creating a basic map using the chosen library.

**Phase 3: Displaying Markers and Site Information**
**Objective:** Display markers on the map, representing historical sites, and show site information upon clicking a marker.

* **Data Structure for Sites:**
    * Task: Define a data structure to hold information about each historical site (e.g., name, location, description, image, virtual tour link).
    * Instructions: Create an array of objects, each representing a site.
* **Adding Markers to the Map:**
    * Task: Add markers to the map component based on the site locations.
    * Instructions: Use the map library's marker API to add markers for each site.
* **Display Site Information on Click:**
    * Task: Implement an event handler for marker clicks to display site information.
    * Instructions: Use the marker's click event to trigger a function that updates the state of the application with the selected site's information.
* **Create an Info Panel Component:**
    * Task: Create a new component called `InfoPanel` to display the site information.
    * Instructions: The `InfoPanel` component will receive the site data as props and render the site's name, description, image, and a link to the virtual tour (if available).

**Phase 4: Implementing a Virtual Tour Feature (Optional)**
**Objective:** Add a virtual tour feature for selected sites, using a 3D model or immersive video.

* **Choose a Virtual Tour Platform:**
    * Task: Research and select a platform to provide virtual tours (e.g., Google Street View, Matterport).
    * Resources: Provide links to documentation and tutorials for the chosen platform.
* **Integrate Virtual Tour into InfoPanel:**
    * Task: Integrate the chosen virtual tour platform into the `InfoPanel` component.
    * Instructions: Use the platform's API or embed code to display the virtual tour for the selected site.

**Phase 5: Styling and Enhancing the User Interface**
**Objective:** Improve the visual appearance of the map and site information display.

* **Basic CSS Styling:**
    * Task: Create a CSS file for styling the map, markers, and the `InfoPanel` component.
    * Instructions: Apply CSS styles to improve the layout, colors, and fonts of the application.
* **UI Enhancements:**
    * Task: Implement additional UI features to enhance user experience.
    * Ideas:
        * Add a search bar to filter historical sites.
        * Implement a navigation bar to switch between different map regions.
        * Provide an option to toggle between different map layers (e.g., satellite view, street view).

**Final Project Submission**
* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**
* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
* **Creativity:** The application demonstrates creative solutions and an engaging user experience.

This scaffolded project guide helps students learn React by building a more complex interactive application. They will gain experience with map libraries, data management, event handling, and UI design, while exploring historical sites through an immersive experience.
