## Project Title: Job Portal for Skilled Laborers

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that simulates a basic job portal for skilled laborers, allowing employers to post jobs and workers to browse and apply.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-job-portal`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Basic Components and Data Structures**

**Objective:** Create fundamental React components and define data structures for jobs and workers.

* **Job Listing Component:**
    * Task: Create a `JobListing` component to display individual job postings.
    * Instructions: Include elements for job title, company name, location, description, and application button.
    * Resources: Link to React documentation on component creation.
* **Worker Profile Component:**
    * Task: Create a `WorkerProfile` component to display worker profiles.
    * Instructions: Include elements for worker name, skills, experience, and contact information.
* **Data Structure for Jobs:**
    * Task: Define a JavaScript object structure for job data (e.g., `jobTitle`, `companyName`, `location`, `description`).
    * Resources: Link to JavaScript object documentation.
* **Data Structure for Workers:**
    * Task: Define a JavaScript object structure for worker data (e.g., `name`, `skills`, `experience`, `contact`).

**Phase 3: Displaying Static Job Listings**

**Objective:** Fetch and display static job data in a list format.

* **Job Data Array:**
    * Task: Create an array of sample `Job` objects with different job data.
    * Instructions: Use the defined `Job` structure from Phase 2.
* **Job List Component:**
    * Task: Create a `JobList` component to render the list of jobs.
    * Instructions: Map through the job data array and render a `JobListing` component for each job.
* **Render Job List:**
    * Task: Render the `JobList` component in the main `App` component.

**Phase 4: Implementing Basic Search Functionality**

**Objective:** Add search functionality to filter job listings based on keywords.

* **Search Input:**
    * Task: Add a search input field to the `JobList` component.
    * Instructions: Use a controlled input element to track the user's search term.
* **Filtering Jobs:**
    * Task: Implement a function to filter the job data array based on the search term.
    * Instructions: Filter the array by matching the search term against the job title, description, or other relevant fields.
* **Updating Display:**
    * Task: Re-render the `JobList` component with the filtered data whenever the search term changes.

**Phase 5: Implementing Basic Application Functionality**

**Objective:** Allow users to simulate applying for jobs.

* **Application Button:**
    * Task: Add a button labeled "Apply" to the `JobListing` component.
    * Instructions: Implement an event handler for the button click.
* **Application Logic:**
    * Task: Implement simple application logic, e.g., displaying a confirmation message or updating a state variable to track applied jobs.
    * Instructions: This could involve adding the job to a user's "applied jobs" list or simply logging the application to the console for now.

**Phase 6: (Optional) Implementing User Authentication**

**Objective:** Add basic user registration and login functionality (can be simplified for the initial version).

* **Registration Form:**
    * Task: Create a registration form component.
    * Instructions: Include fields for username, password, and potentially other relevant information.
* **Login Form:**
    * Task: Create a login form component.
    * Instructions: Include fields for username and password.
* **Authentication Logic:**
    * Task: Implement simplified authentication logic (e.g., storing user data in local storage).
    * Instructions: This could involve validating credentials against stored user data.

**Phase 7: (Optional) Implementing Dynamic Data Fetching**

**Objective:** Fetch job data from an external source, such as a simple JSON file or a mock API.

* **Data Fetching Function:**
    * Task: Create a function to fetch job data asynchronously.
    * Instructions: Use `fetch()` or a library like `axios` to fetch data from the external source.
* **Updating State with Fetched Data:**
    * Task: Update the state in the `JobList` component with the fetched job data.
    * Instructions: Use the `useState` hook to manage the fetched data.

**Final Project Submission**

* Combine All Phases: Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* Code Review and Feedback: Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* Project Presentation: Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

* Functionality: The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* Design: The application is user-friendly and visually appealing.
* Understanding: The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a step-by-step approach to learning React, helping students build confidence and competence in developing a more complex React application.
