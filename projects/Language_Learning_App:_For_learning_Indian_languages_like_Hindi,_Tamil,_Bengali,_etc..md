## Project Title: Language Learning App (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali)

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a simple React application that allows users to learn basic vocabulary and phrases in Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: [Node.js Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/)
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app language-learning-app`.
    * Resources: [create-react-app Documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Building the Basic UI Structure**

**Objective:** Create the basic UI structure for the application.

* **Create Language Selection Component:**
    * Task: Create a component called `LanguageSelection` to display a list of languages (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali).
    * Instructions: Use a dropdown menu or buttons to allow users to select their desired language.
    * Activity: Implement state management to track the selected language.
* **Create Vocabulary List Component:**
    * Task: Create a component called `VocabularyList` that displays a list of vocabulary words and their translations.
    * Instructions: This component will initially display a placeholder list.
    * Activity: Implement state management to hold the list of vocabulary words.
* **Create Phrase List Component:**
    * Task: Create a component called `PhraseList` that displays a list of common phrases and their translations.
    * Instructions: This component will initially display a placeholder list.
    * Activity: Implement state management to hold the list of phrases.

**Phase 3: Fetching Language Data**

**Objective:** Fetch language data from an external source.

* **Choose Data Source:**
    * Task: Choose a suitable source for vocabulary and phrase data (e.g., online API, JSON file, database).
    * Resources: Explore options for language data APIs or create your own JSON file.
* **Fetch Data in LanguageSelection Component:**
    * Task: Implement logic in `LanguageSelection` to fetch the appropriate vocabulary and phrase data based on the selected language.
    * Instructions: Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data when the selected language changes.
* **Update VocabularyList and PhraseList:**
    * Task: Update the `VocabularyList` and `PhraseList` components to display the fetched language data.
    * Instructions: Pass the fetched data as props to these components.

**Phase 4: Implementing Interactive Learning**

**Objective:** Implement features for interactive language learning.

* **Add Flashcard Feature:**
    * Task: Create a component called `Flashcard` that displays a vocabulary word or phrase and its translation.
    * Instructions: Use state to manage the current displayed item and implement a button to reveal the translation.
* **Implement a Quiz Feature:**
    * Task: Create a component called `Quiz` that presents a series of multiple-choice questions about vocabulary or phrases.
    * Instructions: Use state to manage the current question, the user's answer, and the quiz score.
* **Provide Feedback:**
    * Task: Implement logic to provide feedback to the user based on their answers in the quiz.
    * Instructions: Display a message indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

**Phase 5: Styling and Enhancement**

**Objective:** Apply styles and enhance the application's user experience.

* **Styling with CSS:**
    * Task: Create a CSS file for the application and style the components (e.g., language selection, vocabulary list, flashcard, quiz).
    * Instructions: Use CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
* **Add Audio Feature:**
    * Task: Implement audio playback for vocabulary words and phrases.
    * Instructions: Use audio elements or a library to play audio recordings associated with the language data.
* **Improve User Experience:**
    * Task: Implement features to improve the user experience, such as:
        * Progress tracking (e.g., displaying the number of completed flashcard rounds).
        * User settings (e.g., adjusting the difficulty level of the quiz).
        * Personalized learning (e.g., focusing on words or phrases the user has struggled with).

**Final Project Submission**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a step-by-step approach to learning React, helping students build confidence and competence in developing a language learning application.
