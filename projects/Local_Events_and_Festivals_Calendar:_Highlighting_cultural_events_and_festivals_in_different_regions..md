## Project Title: Local Events and Festivals Calendar

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have built a React application that displays a calendar of local events and festivals. The calendar will allow users to navigate through different months and view event details.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-events-calendar`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Creating the Basic Calendar Structure**

**Objective:** Build the fundamental structure for displaying the calendar.

* **Calendar Component:**
    * Task: Create a new component called `Calendar`.
    * Instructions: Define a functional component that renders a basic calendar layout with elements for displaying month and year navigation, and a grid representing the days of the month.
* **Month and Year Navigation:**
    * Task: Implement functionality to navigate between months and years.
    * Instructions: Create buttons or controls for users to move forward and backward in time, and update the calendar display accordingly.
* **Day Grid:**
    * Task: Create a grid structure to display individual days within the current month.
    * Instructions: Render a grid of cells representing each day of the month, with appropriate styling for weekdays, weekends, and current date highlighting.

**Phase 3: Displaying Event Data**

**Objective:** Integrate event data and display them on the calendar.

* **Event Data Structure:**
    * Task: Define a data structure to store event information.
    * Instructions: Create an object or array containing event details such as title, date, time, location, and description.
    * Example:
        ```javascript
        const eventsData = [
            { title: "Summer Music Festival", date: "2024-07-15", location: "City Park", description: "A weekend of live music and entertainment." },
            { title: "Art Exhibition", date: "2024-07-22", location: "Art Gallery", description: "A showcase of contemporary art." },
            // ... more events
        ];
        ```
* **Rendering Events:**
    * Task: Map over the event data and display events on the corresponding days of the calendar grid.
    * Instructions: Filter events based on the current month, identify matching dates, and render event information within the relevant day cell.

**Phase 4: Event Details and User Interaction**

**Objective:** Allow users to view event details and interact with events.

* **Event Detail Component:**
    * Task: Create a new component called `EventDetails` to display details for a selected event.
    * Instructions: This component will receive event data as a prop and render title, date, time, location, and description information.
* **Event Click Handling:**
    * Task: Implement event click handling on individual day cells.
    * Instructions: When a user clicks on a day cell containing an event, display the `EventDetails` component for that specific event.
* **Event Filtering and Sorting:**
    * Task: (Optional) Implement filtering and sorting functionality to enhance user experience.
    * Instructions: Allow users to filter events based on categories, dates, or keywords. Implement sorting options to arrange events chronologically or by relevance.

**Phase 5: Styling and User Interface Design**

**Objective:** Apply styles and enhance the visual presentation of the calendar application.

* **Basic Styling:**
    * Task: Create a CSS file for the `Calendar` component and apply basic styling to the calendar layout, month navigation, and day grid.
    * Instructions: Focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly design for the calendar.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Task: Ensure the calendar application is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
    * Instructions: Use media queries or responsive design frameworks to adjust the layout and styling based on screen width.
* **Event Styling:**
    * Task: Apply styling to events displayed on the calendar grid.
    * Instructions: Use colors, icons, or other visual cues to distinguish between different event types or highlight important events.

**Final Project Submission**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
