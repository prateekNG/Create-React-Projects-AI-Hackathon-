## Project Title: Local Travel and Homestay App

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a functional React application that allows users to browse and book local homestays, providing a platform for connecting travelers with local hosts offering unique and authentic experiences.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-homestay-app`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Creating Basic Components**

**Objective:** Define the fundamental components of the application.

* **Homepage Component (`Homepage.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component that displays a welcome message, a brief description of the app, and a search bar for users to find homestays.
    * Instructions: Use basic HTML elements and styling to create a visually appealing homepage.
* **Homestay List Component (`HomestayList.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component that will display a list of available homestays.
    * Instructions: Implement a placeholder structure for displaying homestay information (e.g., title, image, location, price).
* **Homestay Detail Component (`HomestayDetail.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component that displays detailed information about a specific homestay.
    * Instructions: Include details like description, amenities, photos, reviews, and booking options.

**Phase 3: State Management and Data Fetching**

**Objective:** Manage data for homestays and implement data fetching from a backend or API.

* **Mock Data (`homestays.js`):**
    * Task: Create a JavaScript file to hold mock homestay data for initial development.
    * Instructions: Define an array of objects representing homestays, including properties like name, location, description, price, and images.
* **Fetching Data (e.g., `api.js`):**
    * Task: Create a function to fetch homestay data from a backend or API (consider using a placeholder API like JSONPlaceholder).
    * Instructions: Implement `fetch` or an equivalent method to retrieve data.
* **State Management with `useState`:**
    * Task: Use `useState` to manage the list of homestays fetched from the API.
    * Instructions: Update the state with the fetched data and handle potential errors.

**Phase 4: Displaying Homestays and Search Functionality**

**Objective:** Render the list of homestays and implement search functionality.

* **Rendering the List:**
    * Task: Use the `HomestayList` component to display the fetched homestay data.
    * Instructions: Map over the list of homestays and render a `HomestayItem` component for each homestay.
* **Homestay Item Component (`HomestayItem.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component that displays a brief overview of each homestay.
    * Instructions: Display the title, image, location, and price of a single homestay.
    * Task: Implement click functionality to navigate to the `HomestayDetail` component when a user clicks on a homestay item.
* **Search Functionality:**
    * Task: Add a search bar to the `Homepage` component to filter homestays.
    * Instructions: Use `useState` to manage the search query.
    * Task: Filter the homestay list based on the search query in the `HomestayList` component.

**Phase 5: Handling User Interactions and Booking**

**Objective:** Implement user interactions, such as booking and viewing detailed homestay information.

* **Navigation:**
    * Task: Implement navigation between the `Homepage`, `HomestayList`, and `HomestayDetail` components.
    * Instructions: Use React Router to manage navigation and URL routing.
* **Booking Functionality (Mock Implementation):**
    * Task: Add a "Book Now" button in the `HomestayDetail` component.
    * Instructions: Implement basic booking functionality using JavaScript and mock data.
    * Task: Implement a "My Bookings" page that displays the user's booked homestays (consider using local storage for persistence).
* **Review System (Mock Implementation):**
    * Task: Implement a mock review system on the `HomestayDetail` component.
    * Instructions: Allow users to add reviews and display them on the homestay details page.
    * Task: Consider using a rating system (e.g., star ratings) for reviews.

**Phase 6: Styling and UI Enhancements**

**Objective:** Enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the application.

* **CSS Styling:**
    * Task: Add CSS styles to create a visually appealing interface.
    * Instructions: Use CSS to style components like the homepage, navigation bar, search bar, homestay list, and homestay detail page.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Task: Ensure the application is responsive across different screen sizes.
    * Instructions: Use CSS media queries or a responsive framework to adapt the layout to different devices.
* **User Experience:**
    * Task: Improve user interactions and navigation.
    * Instructions: Ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience for browsing, searching, and booking homestays.

**Phase 7: Project Submission and Review**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This project will guide students through creating a functional React application that utilizes core concepts like components, state management, data fetching, user interactions, and styling. By completing this project, students will gain practical experience building a real-world application and develop a strong understanding of React development fundamentals.
