## Project Title: Mental Health Support App: Resources & Networks

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have built a functional React application that provides users with access to mental health resources and information about support networks, fostering a better understanding of mental well-being.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install necessary tools and set up the project structure.

**Install Node.js and npm:**

* **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
* **Resources:** [Official Node.js installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Official npm installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

**Create a New React Project:**

* **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
* **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-mental-health-app`.
* **Resources:** [create-react-app documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/)

**Project Structure Overview:**

* **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
* **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Building the App Layout**

**Objective:** Create the basic layout and structure of the app.

**Homepage (App.js):**

* **Task:** Design the homepage structure including a header, main content area, and footer.
* **Instructions:** Create a functional component `App` that renders the basic HTML structure: header (with app name and navigation), main content area (placeholder for resource lists and other information), and footer (with copyright information).

**Navigation:**

* **Task:** Add navigation links to the header for accessing different sections of the app (e.g., Resources, Support Networks, About).
* **Instructions:** Create a separate component for navigation (e.g., `Navbar`) and render it within the header. Use React Router to handle navigation between sections.
* **Resources:** [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/)

**Phase 3: Resource Listing**

**Objective:** Create a component to display mental health resources.

**Resource Data:**

* **Task:** Create a JavaScript file to hold the resource data (e.g., `resources.js`).
* **Instructions:** Define an array of objects representing resources with properties like title, description, link, category (e.g., crisis hotline, therapy, support groups).

**Resource Card Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component `ResourceCard` that displays individual resource details (title, description, link).
* **Instructions:** Design the card layout with styling (CSS or styled-components).

**Resources List Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component `ResourceList` that displays the list of resources.
* **Instructions:** Fetch resource data from `resources.js`, map over it, and render a `ResourceCard` for each resource.

**Phase 4: Support Networks**

**Objective:** Create a component to display information about support networks.

**Support Network Data:**

* **Task:** Create a JavaScript file to hold data about support networks (e.g., `networks.js`).
* **Instructions:** Define an array of objects representing networks with properties like name, description, website, location (if applicable), contact information.

**Network Info Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component `NetworkInfo` that displays information about a single network.
* **Instructions:** Design the layout to display network name, description, website link, and contact details.

**Networks List Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component `NetworkList` to display a list of support networks.
* **Instructions:** Fetch network data from `networks.js`, map over it, and render a `NetworkInfo` component for each network.

**Phase 5: About Page**

**Objective:** Create an "About" page to provide information about the app.

**About Component:**

* **Task:** Create a component `About` to display content for the "About" page.
* **Instructions:** Include information about the app's purpose, developers, and any relevant resources.

**Phase 6: Filtering and Searching**

**Objective:** Add functionality to filter and search resources.

**Filtering:**

* **Task:** Add filtering options for resources (e.g., by category).
* **Instructions:** Use state to manage the filter selection, filter resource data based on the selection, and update the `ResourceList` component with filtered results.

**Searching:**

* **Task:** Add a search bar to allow users to search for resources.
* **Instructions:** Use state to manage the search query, filter resource data based on the query, and update the `ResourceList` component with search results.

**Phase 7: Styling and UI Enhancements**

**Objective:** Apply styles to make the app visually appealing and user-friendly.

**CSS Styling:**

* **Task:** Use CSS to style the app's layout, components, and typography.
* **Instructions:** Create a CSS file (e.g., `App.css`) and import it into relevant components. Apply styles to elements like header, navigation, resource cards, network info, and overall layout.

**UI Enhancements:**

* **Task:** Enhance the UI with elements like:
    * **Icons:** Use icons to represent different resource types or support networks.
    * **Color Scheme:** Choose a color scheme that promotes a sense of calm and well-being.
    * **Typography:** Use clear and legible fonts for better readability.
    * **Spacing:** Use spacing effectively to create a visually pleasing layout.

**Phase 8: Deployment**

**Objective:** Deploy the completed app to a hosting service.

* **Task:** Choose a hosting service for your app (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).
* **Instructions:** Follow the deployment instructions provided by the chosen hosting service.
* **Resources:** [Netlify documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/), [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/), [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Accessibility:** The app is designed to be accessible to users with disabilities.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for students to build a functional and informative mental health support app using React, equipping them with valuable skills in web development and contributing to mental well-being initiatives.
