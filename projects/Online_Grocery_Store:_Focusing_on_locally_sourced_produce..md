## Project Title: Building a Local Grocery Store App

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a functional React application simulating an online grocery store, showcasing locally sourced produce. The application will allow users to browse a list of products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. 

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-grocery-app`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Creating Core Components**

**Objective:** Develop the fundamental components for the application.

* **Product List Component:**
    * Task: Create a component `ProductList` to display a list of available products.
    * Instructions:
        * Use state to manage the list of products (consider using an array of objects with properties like `name`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `availability`, and `origin`).
        * Display each product using a `Product` component (to be created in the next step).
        * Consider adding pagination or filtering functionality to handle a large product list.
* **Product Component:**
    * Task: Create a component `Product` to display individual product information.
    * Instructions:
        * Receive product data as props (e.g., `name`, `price`, `imageUrl`, `origin`).
        * Render the product's name, price, image, and origin.
        * Include a button to add the product to the cart.
* **Cart Component:**
    * Task: Create a component `Cart` to display the user's selected items.
    * Instructions:
        * Use state to manage the cart items (consider using an array of objects with properties like `product`, `quantity`).
        * Display the cart items in a visually appealing list format.
        * Include a "Checkout" button (to be implemented in Phase 4).

**Phase 3: Handling User Interactions**

**Objective:** Implement functionality for adding items to the cart and managing cart quantities.

* **Adding Products to Cart:**
    * Task: Implement functionality to add products to the cart when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked.
    * Instructions:
        * Update the cart state in the `ProductList` component when a "Add to Cart" button is clicked.
        * Maintain quantities for each product in the cart.
* **Updating Cart Items:**
    * Task: Implement functionality to update the quantity of items in the cart.
    * Instructions:
        * Allow users to adjust the quantity of items in the `Cart` component using "plus" and "minus" buttons.
        * Update the cart state accordingly.

**Phase 4: Checkout Functionality**

**Objective:** Implement the checkout functionality, including order summary and payment processing (simulated).

* **Checkout Page:**
    * Task: Create a component `CheckoutPage` to display the checkout summary and handle payment processing.
    * Instructions:
        * Display the order summary, including total price and list of items.
        * Include a "Place Order" button.
* **Payment Processing (Simulated):**
    * Task: Implement simulated payment processing logic.
    * Instructions:
        * Upon clicking "Place Order", simulate a successful payment.
        * Update the cart state to reflect the completed order (e.g., empty cart).
        * Display a confirmation message to the user.

**Phase 5: Styling and Enhancement**

**Objective:** Apply basic styling and enhance the user experience.

* **Styling with CSS:**
    * Task: Apply basic CSS to style the components and improve the overall appearance.
    * Instructions:
        * Create separate CSS files for each component.
        * Use CSS classes to style elements.
        * Consider responsive design for different screen sizes.
* **User Interface Enhancement:**
    * Task: Enhance the user interface with visual cues and animations.
    * Instructions:
        * Add loading indicators for data fetching.
        * Use transitions for smoother visual effects.
        * Implement a shopping cart icon to indicate the number of items in the cart.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
