## Project Title: Building a Simple Online Voting System

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a basic online voting system using React that allows users to cast votes for different candidates in an election. The application will feature a clear UI for displaying candidates and their vote counts, along with a secure way for users to submit their votes.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-voting-app`.
    * **Resources:** [https://create-react-app.dev/](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Designing the User Interface**

**Objective:** Create the basic UI components for the voting system.

* **Candidate List Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component `CandidateList` that displays a list of candidates.
    * **Instructions:** 
        * Define the structure of a candidate object (name, votes).
        * Implement the `CandidateList` component to display the candidate name and their current vote count.
* **Voting Form Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `VotingForm` component that allows users to select a candidate and submit their vote.
    * **Instructions:**
        * Use a radio button group to let users select a candidate from the list.
        * Implement a button to submit the vote.
* **Results Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `Results` component that displays the final vote count for each candidate after voting is closed.
    * **Instructions:** 
        * Display the candidate name and their total votes in a visually appealing manner.

**Phase 3: Implementing Voting Logic and State Management**

**Objective:** Handle user input, store votes, and update the display accordingly.

* **State Management with `useState`:**
    * **Task:** Use the `useState` hook to manage the state of the voting system.
    * **Instructions:**
        * Initialize the state with an array of candidates and their initial vote counts.
        * Update the state when a user casts a vote.
* **Event Handling in `VotingForm`:**
    * **Task:** Implement event handling in `VotingForm` to capture the user's selected candidate and submit the vote.
    * **Instructions:**
        * Use the `onChange` event handler to track the selected candidate.
        * Use the `onClick` event handler on the submit button to update the state with the chosen candidate's vote.
* **Updating UI with State Changes:**
    * **Task:** Update the `CandidateList` and `Results` components to reflect the changes in the state.
    * **Instructions:** 
        * Re-render the candidate list and results based on the updated state.

**Phase 4: Adding Security and Closing the Voting**

**Objective:** Implement basic security measures and provide functionality to close the voting.

* **Preventing Multiple Votes:**
    * **Task:** Implement logic to prevent users from voting multiple times for the same candidate.
    * **Instructions:** 
        * Use a mechanism to track user votes (e.g., storing user IDs).
        * Prevent users from submitting votes if they have already voted.
* **Closing the Voting:**
    * **Task:** Add a button to close the voting and prevent further votes from being submitted.
    * **Instructions:** 
        * Implement a boolean flag in the state to indicate whether voting is open or closed.
        * Disable the `VotingForm` component when voting is closed.

**Phase 5: Styling the Application**

**Objective:** Apply styles to improve the visual appeal of the voting system.

* **Basic CSS Styling:**
    * **Task:** Create a CSS file and apply basic styles to the components.
    * **Instructions:** 
        * Use CSS to style the `CandidateList`, `VotingForm`, and `Results` components.
        * Make the UI visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Styling Components with CSS-in-JS:**
    * **Task:** Explore styling components using CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or Emotion.
    * **Instructions:**
        * Implement a few basic styles using a CSS-in-JS library.

**Final Project Submission**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a step-by-step approach to learning React while building a functional online voting system, helping students gain practical experience and understanding of React concepts.
