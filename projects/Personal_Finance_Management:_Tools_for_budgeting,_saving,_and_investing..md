## Project Title: Personal Finance Manager

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a functional React application for managing personal finances. The application will allow users to track income, expenses, set budgets, and monitor savings goals. 

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:** 
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-finance-app`.
    * **Resources:** [https://create-react-app.dev/](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Building Core Components**

**Objective:** Create basic React components to structure the application.

* **Dashboard Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a Dashboard component that will display key financial information.
    * **Instructions:** Include sections for displaying current balance, budget overview, and savings progress.
* **Transaction List Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a TransactionList component to render a list of transactions.
    * **Instructions:** Display the date, description, and amount for each transaction.
* **Add Transaction Component:**
    * **Task:** Create an AddTransaction component for adding new transactions.
    * **Instructions:** Include input fields for date, description, amount, and category. 
* **Budget Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a Budget component for setting and viewing budget limits.
    * **Instructions:** Allow users to allocate budgets for different categories (e.g., food, rent, entertainment).
* **Savings Goals Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a SavingsGoals component for setting and monitoring savings targets.
    * **Instructions:** Allow users to define savings goals with target amounts and deadlines.

**Phase 3: Data Management with State**

**Objective:** Implement state management to store and update financial data.

* **Introduction to State:**
    * **Task:** Read about the `useState` hook and state management in functional components.
    * **Resources:** [https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
* **Transaction Data State:**
    * **Task:** Use `useState` to manage an array of transaction objects in the `App` component.
    * **Instructions:** Initialize the state with an empty array.
* **Passing Data as Props:**
    * **Task:** Pass the transaction data as props to the `TransactionList` and `AddTransaction` components.
    * **Instructions:** Use `props` to share information between parent and child components.
* **Adding New Transactions:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to add new transactions to the state.
    * **Instructions:** Update the transaction array in `App` when the `AddTransaction` component submits a new transaction.

**Phase 4: Implementing Functionality**

**Objective:** Add core features to manage finances.

* **Filtering and Sorting Transactions:**
    * **Task:** Implement filtering and sorting functionalities for the transaction list.
    * **Instructions:** Allow users to filter transactions by date, category, or amount and sort them in ascending or descending order.
* **Calculating Current Balance:**
    * **Task:** Calculate and display the current balance based on the transactions.
    * **Instructions:** Sum income and subtract expenses to determine the current balance.
* **Budgeting and Tracking:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to set budget limits for different categories.
    * **Task:** Track spending against budget limits and provide visual indicators (e.g., progress bars).
* **Saving Goals Monitoring:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to set savings goals with target amounts and deadlines.
    * **Task:** Track progress towards savings goals and display progress indicators.

**Phase 5: Styling and Enhancements**

**Objective:** Improve the application's visual appeal and user experience.

* **Styling with CSS:**
    * **Task:** Create a CSS file to style the components and overall layout.
    * **Instructions:** Apply styles to improve the visual presentation and create a clean and intuitive user interface.
* **User Interface Improvements:**
    * **Task:** Implement visual feedback mechanisms for user interactions.
    * **Instructions:** Use animations, transitions, and loading indicators to enhance user experience.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * **Task:** Ensure the application is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
    * **Instructions:** Use media queries or responsive design libraries to optimize the layout for mobile and tablet devices.

**Final Project Submission**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
