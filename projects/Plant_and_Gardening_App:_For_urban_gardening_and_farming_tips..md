## Project Title: Plant and Gardening App

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that provides basic information and tips for urban gardening and farming. This application will include features for displaying plant information, searching for plants, and adding plants to a user's personal garden list.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app plant-app`.
    * **Resources:** [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Building the Basic Structure**

**Objective:** Create the fundamental components for the application.

* **Create Plant Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `Plant` component that will display information about a single plant.
    * **Instructions:** Use props to pass plant data (name, description, image, care instructions) to the component.
    * **Activity:** Design the layout of the `Plant` component using HTML elements and CSS.
* **Create PlantList Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `PlantList` component that will display a list of plants.
    * **Instructions:** Implement a function to fetch plant data (e.g., from a JSON file or an API) and store it in state.
    * **Activity:** Map over the plant data and render a `Plant` component for each plant.
* **Create App Component:**
    * **Task:** Create the `App` component that will be the main entry point of the application.
    * **Instructions:** Render the `PlantList` component within the `App` component.

**Phase 3: Implementing Search Functionality**

**Objective:** Implement a search bar to filter the displayed plants.

* **Add Search Input:**
    * **Task:** Add a search input field to the `App` component.
    * **Instructions:** Use state to manage the search query entered by the user.
* **Filter Plant Data:**
    * **Task:** Modify the `PlantList` component to filter the plant data based on the search query.
    * **Instructions:** Implement a filtering logic that checks if the plant name or description matches the search query.
* **Update Plant List:**
    * **Task:** Update the display of the plant list based on the filtered data.
    * **Activity:** Re-render the plant list with only the filtered plants.

**Phase 4: Implementing Gardening List Functionality**

**Objective:** Allow users to add plants to a personal gardening list.

* **Create Garden List Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a `GardenList` component that displays the user's saved plants.
    * **Instructions:** Use state to manage the list of plants added by the user.
    * **Activity:** Design the layout of the `GardenList` component, including the possibility to remove plants from the list.
* **Add Plant to Garden:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to add a plant to the `GardenList` from the `PlantList`.
    * **Instructions:** Create a button within the `Plant` component that adds the plant to the user's garden list.
    * **Activity:** Update the `GardenList` state whenever a plant is added.
* **Remove Plant from Garden:**
    * **Task:** Implement functionality to remove a plant from the `GardenList`.
    * **Instructions:** Add a button within the `GardenList` that removes the corresponding plant from the list.

**Phase 5: Styling and Enhancement**

**Objective:** Apply styles and add visual enhancements to the application.

* **Apply Basic CSS:**
    * **Task:** Create CSS files to style the components.
    * **Instructions:** Use CSS to style the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of the application.
* **Enhance UI:**
    * **Task:** Improve the user interface by adding visual elements and animations.
    * **Instructions:** Use CSS or libraries like React Bootstrap to create a more appealing and user-friendly UI.
* **Implement Accessibility:**
    * **Task:** Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    * **Instructions:** Consider using ARIA attributes and follow accessibility best practices.

**Phase 6: Further Enhancements (Optional)**

**Objective:** Explore additional features to enhance the application.

* **Add Plant Care Instructions:**
    * **Task:** Include detailed care instructions for each plant.
    * **Instructions:** Design a section within the `Plant` component to display care instructions.
* **Implement Reminders:**
    * **Task:** Add functionality for users to set reminders for watering or other plant care tasks.
    * **Instructions:** Use a library like `react-countdown-timer` to implement reminders.
* **Integrate with External APIs:**
    * **Task:** Integrate with a gardening API to fetch more plant data or provide additional features.
    * **Instructions:** Research and implement an API integration.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a guided path for students to learn React by building a practical application, fostering their understanding of core concepts and allowing them to explore additional features.
