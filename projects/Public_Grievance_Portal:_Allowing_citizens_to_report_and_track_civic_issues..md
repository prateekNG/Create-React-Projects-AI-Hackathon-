## Project Title: Public Grievance Portal

**Objective:** 
By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that allows citizens to submit grievances, track their status, and view a list of resolved issues.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * **Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-grievance-portal`.
    * **Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Building the Basic Structure**

**Objective:** Create basic components for the portal's main sections.

* **Home Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `Home` to display introductory information about the portal.
    * **Instructions:** Create a functional component that includes a heading, a brief description, and a link to the grievance submission form.
* **Grievance Submission Form Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `GrievanceForm` to allow users to submit grievances.
    * **Instructions:** Create a functional component with input fields for details like name, contact information, issue description, location, and category. Include a submit button.
* **Grievances List Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `GrievancesList` to display a list of submitted grievances.
    * **Instructions:** Create a functional component that dynamically renders a list of grievance items. For now, display placeholder data for each grievance.
* **Grievance Details Component:**
    * **Task:** Create a component called `GrievanceDetails` to display the details of a specific grievance.
    * **Instructions:** Create a functional component that will later receive a grievance ID as a prop and fetch the corresponding grievance data to display.

**Phase 3: Handling User Input and Submission**

**Objective:** Implement functionality to receive user input and submit grievances.

* **State Management:**
    * **Task:** Read about state management in React using the `useState` hook.
    * **Resources:** Provide a tutorial or documentation link about `useState`.
* **Input Field Handling:**
    * **Task:** Use `useState` in `GrievanceForm` to manage the input values for each field.
    * **Instructions:** Update the input fields in `GrievanceForm` to reflect changes in the state as the user types.
* **Form Submission:**
    * **Task:** Implement the form submission logic in `GrievanceForm`.
    * **Instructions:** Create an event handler for the submit button that collects the form data from the state and sends it to a backend API (for now, simply log the data to the console).
* **Displaying Submitted Grievances:**
    * **Task:** Update `GrievancesList` to dynamically display the submitted grievances from the state.
    * **Instructions:** Create an array in the state to store submitted grievances and render the list of grievances in `GrievancesList` based on this array.

**Phase 4: Implementing Backend Integration**

**Objective:** Integrate the frontend with a backend API for grievance data persistence and status updates.

* **Backend Setup (Optional):**
    * **Task:** Create a basic backend server using Node.js and Express.
    * **Instructions:** Set up a backend API that handles the creation, retrieval, and updating of grievance data. (This task can be skipped if using a pre-existing API).
* **Fetching Grievances:**
    * **Task:** Implement the functionality to fetch grievances from the backend API in `GrievancesList`.
    * **Instructions:** Use the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the API when the component mounts and update the state accordingly.
* **Updating Grievance Status:**
    * **Task:** Implement the functionality to update the status of a grievance in the backend.
    * **Instructions:** Add a feature to the `GrievanceDetails` component to allow authorized users to update the status of a grievance and send the updated data to the backend.

**Phase 5: Enhancing Functionality and Styling**

**Objective:** Add additional features and style the application for a user-friendly experience.

* **User Authentication (Optional):**
    * **Task:** Implement user authentication to restrict access to specific features (e.g., grievance status updates).
    * **Instructions:** Use a library like `react-router-dom` to create separate routes for login/signup and implement authentication logic.
* **Grievance Tracking:**
    * **Task:** Allow users to view the status of their submitted grievances in `GrievanceDetails`.
    * **Instructions:** Fetch the status from the backend API and display it in `GrievanceDetails` along with other grievance information.
* **Styling and UI Design:**
    * **Task:** Apply CSS styles to improve the visual appearance of the application.
    * **Instructions:** Create a CSS file and import it into the components. Style elements like the header, form fields, buttons, and the grievance list for a cleaner and more user-friendly interface.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
