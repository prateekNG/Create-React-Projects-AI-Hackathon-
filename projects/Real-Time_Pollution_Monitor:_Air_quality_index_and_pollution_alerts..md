## Project Title: Real-Time Pollution Monitor

**Objective:** 
By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that displays real-time air quality index (AQI) data and sends pollution alerts based on user-defined thresholds.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install necessary tools and set up the project structure.

**Install Node.js and npm:**
* **Task:** Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
* **Resources:** Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.

**Create a New React Project:**
* **Task:** Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
* **Instructions:** Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-pollution-monitor`.
* **Resources:** Link to create-react-app documentation.

**Project Structure Overview:**
* **Task:** Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
* **Activity:** Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Building the Core Components**

**Objective:** Create basic React components to display AQI data and manage alerts.

**AQIData Component:**
* **Task:** Create a new component called `AQIData` that fetches and displays AQI data.
* **Instructions:**
    * Use a placeholder API for now (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AirNow) to get sample data.
    * Fetch AQI data from the API using `fetch` or a library like Axios.
    * Store the fetched data in component state using `useState`.
    * Render the data (e.g., PM2.5, Ozone) in a visually appealing format.

**Alert Component:**
* **Task:** Create a new component called `Alert` that displays pollution alerts based on thresholds.
* **Instructions:**
    * Create a `Threshold` component to allow users to set custom alert thresholds for each pollutant.
    * Receive AQI data and thresholds as props from `AQIData`.
    * Display an alert message when AQI values exceed the set thresholds.
    * Use different alert styles (e.g., colors) to indicate severity levels.

**Phase 3: Integrating with a Real-Time API**

**Objective:** Use a real-time API to get updated AQI data.

**Real-Time API Integration:**
* **Task:** Integrate with a real-time API that provides AQI data updates.
* **Instructions:**
    * Research real-time APIs like OpenWeatherMap, AirNow, or others.
    * Choose an API and obtain necessary API keys or authentication information.
    * Implement real-time data updates using WebSockets or a similar technique.
    * Update component state with real-time AQI data.

**Phase 4: Enhancing User Experience**

**Objective:** Improve user interaction and presentation.

**User Interface Design:**
* **Task:** Improve the visual presentation of the application.
* **Instructions:**
    * Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface using CSS or a CSS framework.
    * Consider using visual aids like charts or graphs to display AQI data.
    * Improve layout, color scheme, and overall aesthetics.

**Location Selection:**
* **Task:** Implement location selection for users to view AQI data for different places.
* **Instructions:**
    * Allow users to search for specific locations using a search bar.
    * Fetch AQI data for the selected location from the API.
    * Display the location's AQI data and alerts accordingly.

**Phase 5: Implementing Advanced Features**

**Objective:** Add optional features to enhance the application's functionality.

**Notification System:**
* **Task:** Implement a notification system to send alerts to users directly.
* **Instructions:**
    * Use browser notifications or a third-party service to notify users when AQI exceeds thresholds.
    * Allow users to customize notification settings (e.g., frequency, time of day).

**Historical Data Visualization:**
* **Task:** Allow users to view historical AQI data.
* **Instructions:**
    * Fetch historical AQI data from the API or a database.
    * Use charts or graphs to visualize historical data patterns.
    * Implement features to filter and analyze historical data (e.g., date range selection).

**Final Project Submission**

**Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**
* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Data Accuracy:** The AQI data is fetched accurately from the API and displayed correctly.
* **Real-Time Updates:** The application updates AQI data in real-time.
* **User Interface:** The UI is visually appealing, user-friendly, and intuitive.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a structured approach for learning React while creating a real-world application. Students will gain experience in API integration, real-time data handling, user interface design, and implementing advanced features.
