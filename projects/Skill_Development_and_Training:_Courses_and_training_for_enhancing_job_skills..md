## Project Title: SkillUp - A Course and Training Finder

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a functional React application that displays a list of courses and training programs, allowing users to search and filter them based on specific criteria.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app skillup-app`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Building the Basic Structure**

**Objective:** Create the basic layout of the application and set up components for the course listings.

* **Create Components:**
    * Task: Create the following components:
        * `App.js`: The main component that will hold the entire application.
        * `CourseList.js`: Component to display the list of courses.
        * `CourseCard.js`: Component to display individual course details.
    * Instructions: Create these components within the `src/components` directory.
* **Layout:**
    * Task: Design the basic layout of the app within `App.js`:
        * Include a search bar for filtering courses.
        * Use `CourseList.js` to display the course listings.
* **Data Placeholder:**
    * Task: In `CourseList.js`, create a placeholder array of course data to be used for initial development.
    * Instructions: Define a simple array of objects, each containing course name, description, and other relevant information.

**Phase 3: Implementing Search Functionality**

**Objective:** Implement search functionality to filter courses based on user input.

* **State Management:**
    * Task: Use the `useState` hook in `App.js` to manage the search query.
    * Instructions: Initialize an empty string state for the search query and create a function to update this state when the search input changes.
* **Search Filtering:**
    * Task: In `CourseList.js`, filter the course data based on the search query from the `App.js` state.
    * Instructions: Use a filter function to display only courses whose name or description contains the entered search term.

**Phase 4: Enhancing Course Details**

**Objective:** Add more details and styling to the course cards.

* **CourseCard Components:**
    * Task: Enhance `CourseCard.js` to display:
        * Course name, description, instructor details (optional), category, and rating (optional).
        * Use props to pass course data from `CourseList.js` to `CourseCard.js`.
* **Styling:**
    * Task: Add basic styling to `CourseCard.js` using CSS or styled-components.
    * Instructions: Apply styles to make the course cards visually appealing and ensure they are responsive across different screen sizes.

**Phase 5: Dynamic Data Fetching**

**Objective:** Fetch course data from an external API or a mock data source.

* **Data Source:**
    * Task: Choose a suitable data source for your course data:
        * **API:** Use a public API (e.g.,  a course-related API or a mock API).
        * **Mock Data:** Create a local JSON file with mock course data.
* **Fetch Data:**
    * Task: Implement a function in `CourseList.js` to fetch course data from the chosen source.
    * Instructions: Use `useEffect` to fetch the data when the component mounts and update the course data state accordingly.

**Phase 6: Implementing Filtering and Sorting**

**Objective:** Allow users to filter and sort courses based on specific criteria.

* **Filter Options:**
    * Task: Add a filter section in `App.js` with options for filtering by category or rating (if applicable).
    * Instructions: Use state to manage the selected filter options.
* **Filtering Logic:**
    * Task: Implement filtering logic in `CourseList.js` to filter the course data based on the selected filter options.
    * Instructions: Combine filtering based on the search query and selected filter options.
* **Sorting:**
    * Task: Implement sorting functionality in `CourseList.js` to sort courses based on name, rating, or other criteria.
    * Instructions: Allow users to select a sorting option from a dropdown or a button group.

**Phase 7: Additional Features (Optional)**

**Objective:** Implement additional features to enhance the application.

* **Course Details Page:**
    * Task: Create a `CourseDetails.js` component to display detailed information about a selected course.
    * Instructions: Use routing (e.g., React Router) to navigate to the course details page when a course card is clicked.
* **User Authentication:**
    * Task: Implement user registration and login functionality.
    * Instructions: Use a backend service or an authentication library (e.g., Firebase) to handle user authentication.
* **Course Enrollment:**
    * Task: Implement functionality to allow users to enroll in courses.
    * Instructions: Use state or a backend service to manage enrollment data.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a structured approach for students to learn React by building a practical application, fostering a deep understanding of core concepts and enabling them to create interactive user experiences.
