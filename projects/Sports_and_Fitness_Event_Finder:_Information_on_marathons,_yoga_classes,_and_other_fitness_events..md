## Project Title: Sports and Fitness Event Finder

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have built a React application that displays information about various sports and fitness events, allowing users to filter and search for events based on type, location, and date.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-event-finder`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Creating Basic Components**

**Objective:** Learn about JSX and create basic React components.

* **Introduction to JSX:**
    * Task: Read about JSX syntax and its role in React.
    * Resources: Provide a brief tutorial or video explaining JSX.
* **Event List Component:**
    * Task: Create a new component called `EventList` that will display a list of events.
    * Instructions: Write a functional component that returns a `div` containing a list of events (e.g., `ul` with `li` elements).
* **Event Item Component:**
    * Task: Create a new component called `EventItem` that will display details of a single event.
    * Instructions: Write a functional component that receives event data as props and renders event information like name, type, location, and date.
* **Render Components:**
    * Task: Render `EventList` and `EventItem` components in the main `App` component.
    * Instructions: Import `EventList` into `App.js` and include it in the JSX returned by `App`.

**Phase 3: Data Fetching and State Management**

**Objective:** Learn how to fetch data from an API and manage state in React.

* **Fetching Data with Axios:**
    * Task: Read about fetching data from APIs using Axios.
    * Resources: Provide links to Axios documentation and tutorials.
    * Task: Install Axios as a dependency using `npm install axios`.
* **Data Source:**
    * Task: Choose a public API that provides data about sports and fitness events.
    * Resources: Provide links to relevant APIs (e.g., Eventbrite, Meetup).
* **State Management with useState:**
    * Task: Use the `useState` hook to store fetched event data in the `EventList` component.
    * Instructions: Initialize the state with an empty array and update it with the fetched data.
* **Rendering Event Items:**
    * Task: Modify the `EventList` component to map over the fetched events and render an `EventItem` component for each.

**Phase 4: Filtering and Searching Events**

**Objective:** Implement filtering and searching functionality to allow users to find specific events.

* **Filtering Events:**
    * Task: Add state variables to `EventList` to track filter criteria (e.g., event type, location).
    * Instructions: Create a filter function that uses the state variables to filter the event data.
* **Search Functionality:**
    * Task: Add an input field to allow users to search for events by name.
    * Instructions: Create a search function that filters the event data based on the input value.
* **Rendering Filtered Results:**
    * Task: Modify the `EventList` component to render only the filtered and searched events.
    * Instructions: Update the mapping logic to display only events that match the current filter and search criteria.

**Phase 5: Enhancing User Interface and User Experience**

**Objective:** Design a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

* **Styling with CSS:**
    * Task: Apply CSS styles to improve the visual appearance of the event finder.
    * Instructions: Create a CSS file and import it into the components to style the layout, elements, and typography.
* **User Feedback:**
    * Task: Implement mechanisms to provide feedback to the user (e.g., loading indicators, error messages).
    * Instructions: Use state and conditional rendering to show appropriate messages while fetching data or handling errors.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Task: Make the application responsive to different screen sizes.
    * Instructions: Use media queries in CSS or a responsive design library to ensure the application looks good on various devices.

**Phase 6: Project Deployment (Optional)**

**Objective:** Deploy the application to a web hosting service.

* **Build the Application:**
    * Task: Run `npm run build` to create a production build of the application.
* **Choose a Hosting Service:**
    * Task: Select a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
    * Resources: Provide links to the chosen hosting service documentation.
* **Deploy the Application:**
    * Task: Follow the instructions of the hosting service to deploy the built application.

**Final Project Submission**

* Combine All Phases: Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* Code Review and Feedback: Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* Project Presentation: Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

* Functionality: The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* Styling: The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* Data Handling: The application effectively fetches, processes, and displays data from the chosen API.
* Understanding: The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project guide provides a structured approach for students to learn React through building a practical and useful application. It emphasizes key concepts like data fetching, state management, filtering, and UI design, helping students gain a solid foundation in React development.
