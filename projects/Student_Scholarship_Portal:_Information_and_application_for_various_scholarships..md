## Student Scholarship Portal: A React Project Guide

**Project Title:** Student Scholarship Portal

**Objective:**  By the end of this project, students will have built a React application that displays information about various scholarships and allows users to apply for them.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app my-scholarship-portal`.
    * Resources: [https://create-react-app.dev/](https://create-react-app.dev/)
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Designing the Basic Layout**

**Objective:** Create the basic structure and components for the application.

* **Create Header Component:**
    * Task: Create a `Header` component to display the title and navigation elements.
    * Instructions: Create a functional component named `Header` that renders a header element with appropriate styling.
* **Create Main Content Area:**
    * Task: Create a `Main` component to house the scholarship listing and application form.
    * Instructions: Create a functional component named `Main` that renders a main section with placeholders for future content.
* **Create Footer Component:**
    * Task: Create a `Footer` component to display copyright information and contact details.
    * Instructions: Create a functional component named `Footer` that renders a footer element with appropriate content.
* **Integrate Components:**
    * Task: Render the `Header`, `Main`, and `Footer` components within the `App` component to build the basic application layout.
    * Instructions: Import the components and use JSX to render them in the appropriate order within the `App` component.

**Phase 3: Displaying Scholarship Information**

**Objective:** Fetch scholarship data and display it in a user-friendly way.

* **Prepare Scholarship Data:**
    * Task: Create a JSON file (`scholarshipData.json`) with placeholder scholarship data (e.g., name, description, deadline, eligibility).
    * Instructions: Design the structure of your scholarship data object with necessary fields.
* **Fetch Scholarship Data:**
    * Task: Implement logic to fetch scholarship data from the `scholarshipData.json` file using `fetch` or an appropriate library.
    * Instructions: Create a function that retrieves data from the JSON file.
* **Create Scholarship Card Component:**
    * Task: Create a `ScholarshipCard` component to display information about each scholarship.
    * Instructions: Create a functional component named `ScholarshipCard` that takes scholarship data as a prop and renders it in a visually appealing card format.
* **Render Scholarship List:**
    * Task: Render a list of `ScholarshipCard` components in the `Main` component using the fetched data.
    * Instructions: Use JavaScript's `map` function to iterate over the fetched data and render a `ScholarshipCard` for each scholarship.

**Phase 4: Implementing the Application Form**

**Objective:** Create a form for users to apply for scholarships.

* **Create Application Form Component:**
    * Task: Create an `ApplicationForm` component to handle user input and submit the application.
    * Instructions: Create a functional component named `ApplicationForm` that contains input fields for necessary information (e.g., name, email, major, statement of purpose) and a submit button.
* **Handle Form Submission:**
    * Task: Implement form submission functionality to capture user input and send it to a server (simulated or real).
    * Instructions: Use the `onSubmit` event handler for the form to collect user input and send it to a server using a `fetch` request.
* **Display Form in Main Component:**
    * Task: Render the `ApplicationForm` component in the `Main` component.
    * Instructions: Use JSX to include the `ApplicationForm` component in the `Main` component.

**Phase 5: Styling and User Experience**

**Objective:** Apply styles to make the application visually appealing and improve user experience.

* **CSS Styling:**
    * Task: Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to style components and elements.
    * Instructions: Use CSS to style the header, footer, scholarship cards, application form, and other elements to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Task: Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes.
    * Instructions: Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styles based on screen size.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Task: Implement error handling for form submission and data fetching.
    * Instructions: Add error handling logic to display appropriate error messages to the user in case of network issues or form validation errors.
* **Accessibility:**
    * Task: Make the application accessible to users with disabilities.
    * Instructions: Use semantic HTML elements, provide alt text for images, and ensure the application is keyboard-navigable.

**Phase 6: Additional Features (Optional)**

* **Search Functionality:**
    * Task: Implement a search bar to allow users to filter scholarships based on keywords.
    * Instructions: Use state to manage search input and filter the scholarship data accordingly.
* **Filtering Options:**
    * Task: Add filters to narrow down scholarships based on criteria like deadline, major, or financial need.
    * Instructions: Use state to manage filter options and apply them to the scholarship data.
* **User Authentication:**
    * Task: Implement user registration and login to allow users to save their application progress.
    * Instructions: Use a suitable authentication library (e.g., Firebase) to handle user authentication.
* **Integration with a Database:**
    * Task: Store scholarship data and user applications in a database for persistence.
    * Instructions: Use a database (e.g., MongoDB) and a database library (e.g., Mongoose) to interact with the database.

**Final Project Submission:**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

**Note:** This scaffolded project guide provides a comprehensive framework for building a student scholarship portal using React. Students can customize the features and complexity based on their learning objectives and skill levels.
