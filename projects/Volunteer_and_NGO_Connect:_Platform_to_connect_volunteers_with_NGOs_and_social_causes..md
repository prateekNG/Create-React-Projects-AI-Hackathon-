## Project Title: Volunteer and NGO Connect

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have created a React application that connects volunteers with NGOs and social causes, enabling users to browse available opportunities, search for specific causes, and contact organizations.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run `npx create-react-app volunteer-ngo-connect`.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., `src`, `public`, `package.json`).

**Phase 2: Building the Basic UI Components**

**Objective:** Design and create the fundamental components for the application's user interface.

* **Homepage Component (`HomePage.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component that displays a welcome message, brief description of the platform, and links to other sections (e.g., browse NGOs, search for causes).
    * Instructions: Include relevant text content, images, and links to other components.
* **NGO List Component (`NGOList.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component to display a list of NGOs.
    * Instructions: Use a placeholder array of NGOs with basic information (name, description, location, website) for now.
    * Render each NGO as a card or list item with key information and a link to the NGO's profile.
* **NGO Profile Component (`NGOProfile.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component to display the detailed profile of an NGO.
    * Instructions: Use props to pass NGO data from `NGOList` and display the full information, including volunteer opportunities.
* **Volunteer Opportunity Component (`VolunteerOpportunity.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component to represent a single volunteer opportunity.
    * Instructions: Display details like title, description, location, and application instructions.

**Phase 3: Data Management and API Integration**

**Objective:** Implement data fetching and storage for NGO and volunteer opportunity information.

* **Create Mock Data:**
    * Task: Replace the placeholder NGO data with a more realistic set of mock data.
    * Instructions: Use a JavaScript file or a data structure to store an array of NGOs with detailed information.
* **Implement Data Fetching:**
    * Task: Choose a method for fetching data (e.g., fetch API, Axios).
    * Instructions: Implement a function to retrieve data from a data source (for now, your mock data file).
    * Use `useState` to store the fetched data in the appropriate components.
* **Handle API Integration (Optional):**
    * Task: If available, integrate with a real API to fetch NGO and volunteer opportunity data.
    * Instructions: Research and connect to an API (e.g., a volunteer database, NGO directory).

**Phase 4: Search and Filtering Functionality**

**Objective:** Enable users to search and filter available NGOs and opportunities.

* **Search Bar Component (`SearchBar.js`):**
    * Task: Create a component with a search input field.
    * Instructions: Use `useState` to manage the search term and pass it as a prop to `NGOList`.
* **Filter Logic in `NGOList`:**
    * Task: Implement filtering logic in `NGOList`.
    * Instructions: Filter the list of NGOs based on the search term, matching against NGO name, description, or cause keywords.

**Phase 5: User Interaction and Feedback**

**Objective:** Add features for user interaction and feedback.

* **Contact Form (`ContactForm.js`):**
    * Task: Create a contact form component.
    * Instructions: Include fields for the user's name, email, and message.
    * Implement functionality to send the message to the NGO (using a mock email service or API integration).
* **Feedback System (Optional):**
    * Task: Implement a feedback system to collect user feedback on the platform.
    * Instructions: Use a form to collect feedback from users and store it for later analysis.

**Phase 6: Styling and UI Enhancements**

**Objective:** Apply styling to improve the application's visual appeal and user experience.

* **CSS Styling:**
    * Task: Create a CSS file to apply styles to the components.
    * Instructions: Use CSS to style elements, colors, fonts, and layouts to create a clean and visually appealing interface.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Task: Ensure the application adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    * Instructions: Use media queries and flexible layouts to achieve responsive design.
* **UI/UX Design:**
    * Task: Consider the user experience and optimize the flow of the application.
    * Instructions: Apply best practices for UI/UX design to create a user-friendly interface.

**Final Project Submission**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your React application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.

This scaffolded project provides a structured approach for students to learn React by building a real-world application. Through each phase, they gain experience in creating components, managing data, implementing user interactions, and styling the application.
