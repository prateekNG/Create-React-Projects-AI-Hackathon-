    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Designing the Application's Structure**

**Objective:** Create the basic components that will form the foundation of the WasteWise application.

* **Homepage Component (Homepage.js):**
    * Task: Create a component named Homepage that will be the landing page of the application.
    * Instructions: The component should display introductory text about WasteWise, its purpose, and links to other sections of the application.
* **Waste Information Component (WasteInfo.js):**
    * Task: Create a component named WasteInfo that will display general information about waste disposal and recycling.
    * Instructions: Include sections on the importance of proper waste management, common waste categories, and the environmental impact of improper disposal.
* **Recycling Guide Component (RecyclingGuide.js):**
    * Task: Create a component named RecyclingGuide that will provide users with a comprehensive guide to recycling.
    * Instructions: The component should list common materials, their recycling guidelines, and any specific disposal instructions.
* **Quiz Component (Quiz.js):**
    * Task: Create a component named Quiz that will present users with a multiple-choice quiz about waste disposal and recycling.
    * Instructions: Include a question, answer options, and functionality to check answers and provide feedback.
* **Material Database Component (MaterialDatabase.js):**
    * Task: Create a component named MaterialDatabase that will allow users to search for information about specific materials.
    * Instructions: Include a search bar for users to input material names and display relevant information about its disposal and recycling.

**Phase 3: Building the Homepage and Navigation**

**Objective:** Implement the homepage and navigation between different sections of the application.

* **Homepage Content:**
    * Task: Add content to the Homepage component, including introductory text, links to other sections, and visual elements like images or icons.
    * Instructions:  Ensure the content is engaging and informative for users.
* **Navigation Links:**
    * Task: Implement navigation links within the Homepage component to allow users to access the Waste Information, Recycling Guide, Quiz, and Material Database sections.
    * Instructions: Utilize React Router to handle navigation between components. 

**Phase 4: Implementing the Waste Information and Recycling Guide Sections**

**Objective:** Build the Waste Information and Recycling Guide components, providing users with detailed knowledge about waste management and recycling.

* **Waste Information Content:**
    * Task: Populate the WasteInfo component with informative text, images, and graphics about different aspects of waste disposal and recycling. 
    * Instructions: Use clear headings, concise paragraphs, and visually appealing elements to enhance user engagement.
* **Recycling Guide Content:**
    * Task: Create a comprehensive list of recyclable materials in the RecyclingGuide component. 
    * Instructions: Include detailed instructions on how to prepare each material for recycling, any specific requirements, and common misconceptions about recycling. 
* **Dynamic Content (Optional):**
    * Task: Use a JavaScript object or an external data source to store and display information about materials and their recycling guidelines dynamically.
    * Instructions: Implement a mechanism to display information about a specific material when the user clicks on it or searches for it in the Recycling Guide.

**Phase 5: Implementing the Quiz and Material Database Components**

**Objective:** Create interactive elements for users to test their knowledge and search for information about specific materials.

* **Quiz Questions and Answers:**
    * Task: Create a series of multiple-choice questions within the Quiz component. 
    * Instructions: Use an array or object to store questions and their corresponding answer options. 
* **Quiz Logic and Feedback:**
    * Task: Implement logic to evaluate user answers, provide feedback on correctness, and track the user's score.
    * Instructions: Use state to manage the quiz's current question, user's score, and any relevant feedback messages.
* **Material Database Search Functionality:**
    * Task: Implement search functionality within the MaterialDatabase component, allowing users to input material names.
    * Instructions: Use a search bar and event listeners to capture user input and display relevant information about the searched material.
* **Data Retrieval (Optional):**
    * Task: Use an external data source, like a JSON file or an API, to store and retrieve information about materials and their disposal/recycling guidelines.
    * Instructions: Implement a method to fetch and process data from the chosen source, displaying the retrieved information in the MaterialDatabase component.

**Phase 6: Styling and Enhancing the User Interface**

**Objective:** Apply styling and improve the visual appeal of the WasteWise application.

* **Basic Styling:**
    * Task: Add CSS styles to the components to improve the visual appearance of the application.
    * Instructions: Use CSS classes and selectors to style the content, headings, buttons, links, and other elements. 
* **Responsive Design (Optional):**
    * Task: Design the application to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
    * Instructions: Utilize media queries in CSS or a responsive design framework (like Bootstrap or Material UI) to achieve responsive layouts.
* **UI Enhancement (Optional):**
    * Task: Add visual elements like icons, images, or animations to enhance the user experience.
    * Instructions: Choose appropriate design elements to improve the visual appeal and user engagement within the application.
