## Project Title: Building a Weather Forecast App

**Objective:**

By the end of this project, students will have built a functional React application that displays current weather conditions and forecasts for different regions, including alerts and information about the weather.

**Phases and Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Setting Up the Development Environment**

**Objective:** Install the necessary tools and set up the project structure.

* **Install Node.js and npm:**
    * Task: Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your computer.
    * Resources: Provide links to official installation guides for Node.js and npm.
* **Create a New React Project:**
    * Task: Use create-react-app to bootstrap a new React project.
    * Instructions: Open your terminal and run npx create-react-app my-weather-app.
    * Resources: Link to create-react-app documentation.
* **Project Structure Overview:**
    * Task: Familiarize yourself with the project structure created by create-react-app.
    * Activity: Identify and understand the purpose of key files and directories (e.g., src, public, package.json).

**Phase 2: Basic Application Structure and Components**

**Objective:** Design the initial structure of the application and create basic components.

* **Create Components:**
    * Task: Create the following components:
        * App: Main component that renders the entire application.
        * SearchBar: Allows users to input a location for weather information.
        * WeatherDetails: Displays current weather conditions for the searched location.
        * Forecast: Displays a multi-day weather forecast for the searched location.
        * Alerts: Displays any active weather alerts for the searched location.
* **Structure the App Component:**
    * Task: Organize the App component to include SearchBar, WeatherDetails, Forecast, and Alerts components.
    * Instructions: Use JSX to render the components within the App component.

**Phase 3: Fetching Weather Data**

**Objective:** Integrate a weather API to fetch and display weather data.

* **Choose a Weather API:**
    * Task: Research and select a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) that provides the necessary data.
    * Instructions: Create an account and obtain API keys.
* **Implement Fetching Functionality:**
    * Task: Use the Fetch API or axios library to retrieve weather data from the selected API.
    * Instructions: Write a function in the App component to handle the API request.
    * Instructions: Pass the location from the SearchBar to the API request.
* **Handle API Responses:**
    * Task: Parse the API response and store the data in a state variable.
    * Instructions: Use the useState hook to manage the weather data received from the API.

**Phase 4: Rendering Weather Information**

**Objective:** Display the fetched weather data in the appropriate components.

* **Render WeatherDetails:**
    * Task: Display the current temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc. in the WeatherDetails component.
    * Instructions: Use JSX to render the weather information from the state.
* **Render Forecast:**
    * Task: Display the forecast for the next few days in the Forecast component.
    * Instructions: Extract the forecast data from the API response and render it using JSX.
    * Instructions: Format the data into a user-friendly presentation.
* **Render Alerts:**
    * Task: Display any weather alerts in the Alerts component.
    * Instructions: Extract the alert data from the API response and render it using JSX.
    * Instructions: Format the alerts to be clear and concise.

**Phase 5: Improving User Experience**

**Objective:** Add features and improvements to enhance the application's usability.

* **Error Handling:**
    * Task: Implement error handling for API requests and display informative messages to the user in case of errors.
    * Instructions: Use try-catch blocks to handle API errors.
    * Instructions: Display appropriate messages to the user based on the error.
* **Loading State:**
    * Task: Show a loading indicator while the API request is being processed.
    * Instructions: Use state to manage the loading state and display a loading component during the API call.
* **Unit Testing:**
    * Task: Write unit tests for the components and functions related to weather data fetching and rendering.
    * Instructions: Use a testing library like Jest or React Testing Library.

**Phase 6: Styling and Enhancements**

**Objective:** Style the application and add additional features.

* **Basic Styling:**
    * Task: Apply basic CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of the application.
    * Instructions: Create a separate CSS file and link it to the application.
    * Instructions: Use CSS to style components like the search bar, weather details, and forecast.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * Task: Ensure the application adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
    * Instructions: Use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
* **Advanced Features:**
    * Task (Optional): Implement additional features, such as:
        * Geolocation: Detect the user's location automatically.
        * Weather History: Store previous weather searches for easy access.
        * Interactive Map: Display a map with weather information overlaid.

**Final Project Submission**

* **Combine All Phases:** Ensure all components and functionality are working together as expected.
* **Code Review and Feedback:** Submit your project for a code review session with peers or the instructor.
* **Project Presentation:** Prepare a brief presentation to demonstrate your weather forecast application and explain the development process.

**Assessment Criteria**

* **Functionality:** The application works as expected and meets all the requirements.
* **Code Quality:** The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
* **Styling:** The application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
* **Understanding:** The student demonstrates a clear understanding of React concepts and can explain their code.
* **API Integration:** The application successfully fetches and displays weather data from an API.
* **User Experience:** The application provides a positive and intuitive user experience.

This scaffolded project provides a step-by-step approach to learning React by building a practical and useful weather forecast application. It covers essential concepts like API integration, state management, component design, and styling, allowing students to gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications.
